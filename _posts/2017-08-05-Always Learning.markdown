## Starting off

The problem I have with blogs, and the reason I never seem to stick with any I've tried in the past, is that I don't understand why anyone would care.  It's like when you go on vacation and share photos when you come back, they're not really that interesting to most people who weren't there. Maybe I just need to take better photos. Also my writing is kind of bad, as you'll soon discover if you keep reading.  

Putting all that aside, I'm trying to learn some new things and setting all this up is a mechanism to do that.  I've been exploring github and its possibilities for a while and I figured this would be a good way to play around with some features and get used to the workflow behind it all.

## Always Learning

One thing I've learned about myself as I've made my way through life is that I'm the type that learns by doing.  I can read, and read, and read, but getting in and trying, sometimes failing, and figuring out how to make things work is my way to understanding. There's a lot of satisfaction in getting things done, and incrementally making things better.  Not to mention the ecstatic joy of the "AH HA!" moments.

Generally, we're not static creatures. We hunger for new experiences and new challenges, even if sometimes we have to overcome the intense urge to remain in the relative safety of the mundane.
